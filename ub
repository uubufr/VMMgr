[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The QEMU PC System emulator simulates the following peripherals:

       -   i440FX host PCI bridge and PIIX3 PCI to ISA bridge

       -   Cirrus CLGD 5446 PCI VGA card or dummy VGA card with Bochs VESA extensions (hardware level, including all non standard modes).

       -   PS/2 mouse and keyboard

       -   2 PCI IDE interfaces with hard disk and CD-ROM support

       -   Floppy disk

       -   PCI and ISA network adapters

       -   Serial ports

       -   IPMI BMC, either and internal or external one

       -   Creative SoundBlaster 16 sound card

       -   ENSONIQ AudioPCI ES1370 sound card

       -   Intel 82801AA AC97 Audio compatible sound card

       -   Intel HD Audio Controller and HDA codec

       -   Adlib (OPL2) - Yamaha YM3812 compatible chip

       -   Gravis Ultrasound GF1 sound card

       -   CS4231A compatible sound card

       -   PCI UHCI, OHCI, EHCI or XHCI USB controller and a virtual USB-1.1 hub.

       SMP is supported with up to 255 CPUs.

       QEMU uses the PC BIOS from the Seabios project and the Plex86/Bochs LGPL VGA BIOS.

       QEMU uses YM3812 emulation by Tatsuyuki Satoh.

       QEMU uses GUS emulation (GUSEMU32 <[1mhttp://www.deinmeister.de/gusemu/[22m>) by Tibor "TS" Schütz.

       Note that, by default, GUS shares [1mIRQ[22m(7) with parallel ports and so QEMU must be told to not have parallel ports to have working GUS.

               qemu-system-i386 dos.img -soundhw gus -parallel none

       Alternatively:

               qemu-system-i386 dos.img -device gus,irq=5

       Or some other unclaimed IRQ.

       CS4231A is the chip used in Windows Sound System and GUSMAX products

           For architectures which aim to support live migration compatibility across releases, each release will introduce a new versioned machine type. For example, the 2.8.0 release introduced machine types "pc-i440fx-2.8" and
           "pc-q35-2.8" for the x86_64/i686 architectures.

           To allow live migration of guests from QEMU version 2.8.0, to QEMU version 2.9.0, the 2.9.0 version must support the "pc-i440fx-2.8" and "pc-q35-2.8" machines too. To allow users live migrating VMs to skip multiple
           intermediate releases when upgrading, new releases of QEMU will support machine types from many previous versions.

           Supported machine properties are:

           Define a NUMA node and assign RAM and VCPUs to it.  Set the NUMA distance from a source node to a destination node.

           Legacy VCPU assignment uses [1mcpus [22moption where [4mfirstcpu[24m and [4mlastcpu[24m are CPU indexes. Each [1mcpus [22moption represent a contiguous range of CPU indexes (or a single VCPU if [4mlastcpu[24m is omitted). A non-contiguous set of VCPUs can
           be represented by providing multiple [1mcpus [22moptions. If [1mcpus [22mis omitted on all nodes, VCPUs are automatically split between them.

           For example, the following option assigns VCPUs 0, 1, 2 and 5 to a NUMA node:

                   -numa node,cpus=0-2,cpus=5

           [1mcpu [22moption is a new alternative to [1mcpus [22moption which uses [1msocket-id|core-id|thread-id [22mproperties to assign CPU objects to a [4mnode[24m using topology layout properties of CPU.  The set of properties is machine specific, and
           depends on used machine type/[1msmp [22moptions. It could be queried with [1mhotpluggable-cpus [22mmonitor command.  [1mnode-id [22mproperty specifies [4mnode[24m to which CPU object will be assigned, it's required for [4mnode[24m to be declared with [1mnode[0m
           option before it's used with [1mcpu [22moption.

           For example:

                   -M pc \
                   -smp 1,sockets=2,maxcpus=2 \
                   -numa node,nodeid=0 -numa node,nodeid=1 \
                   -numa cpu,node-id=0,socket-id=0 -numa cpu,node-id=1,socket-id=1

           [1mmem [22massigns a given RAM amount to a node. [1mmemdev [22massigns RAM from a given memory backend device to a node. If [1mmem [22mand [1mmemdev [22mare omitted in all nodes, RAM is split equally between them.

           [1mmem [22mand [1mmemdev [22mare mutually exclusive. Furthermore, if one node uses [1mmemdev[22m, all of them have to use it.

           [4msource[24m and [4mdestination[24m are NUMA node IDs.  [4mdistance[24m is the NUMA distance from [4msource[24m to [4mdestination[24m.  The distance from a node to itself is always 10. If any pair of nodes is given a distance, then all pairs must be
           given distances. Although, when distances are only given in one direction for each pair of nodes, then the distances in the opposite directions are assumed to be the same. If, however, an asymmetrical pair of distances
           is given for even one node pair, then all node pairs must be provided distance values for both directions, even when they are symmetrical. When a node is unreachable from another node, set the pair's distance to 255.

           Note that the -[1mnuma [22moption doesn't allocate any of the specified resources, it just assigns existing resources to NUMA nodes. This means that one still has to use the [1m-m[22m, [1m-smp [22moptions to allocate RAM and VCPUs
           respectively.

           Add a file descriptor to an fd set.  Valid options are:

           [1mfd=[4m[22mfd[0m
               This option defines the file descriptor of which a duplicate is added to fd set.  The file descriptor cannot be stdin, stdout, or stderr.

           [1mset=[4m[22mset[0m
               This option defines the ID of the fd set to add the file descriptor to.

           [1mopaque=[4m[22mopaque[0m
               This option defines a free-form string that can be used to describe [4mfd[24m.

           You can open an image using pre-opened file descriptors from an fd set:

           Set default value of [4mdriver[24m's property [4mprop[24m to [4mvalue[24m, e.g.:

                   qemu-system-i386 -global ide-hd.physical_block_size=4096 disk-image.img

           In particular, you can use this to set driver properties for devices which are created automatically by the machine model. To create a device which is not created automatically and set properties on it, use -[1mdevice[22m.

           -global [4mdriver[24m.[4mprop[24m=[4mvalue[24m is shorthand for -global driver=[4mdriver[24m,property=[4mprop[24m,value=[4mvalue[24m.  The longhand syntax works even when [4mdriver[24m contains a dot.

           Specify boot order [4mdrives[24m as a string of drive letters. Valid drive letters depend on the target architecture. The x86 PC uses: a, b (floppy 1 and 2), c (first hard disk), d (first CD-ROM), n-p (Etherboot from network
           adapter 1-4), hard disk boot is the default. To apply a particular boot order only on the first startup, specify it via [1monce[22m. Note that the [1morder [22mor [1monce [22mparameter should not be used together with the [1mbootindex [22mproperty
           of devices, since the firmware implementations normally do not support both at the same time.

           Interactive boot menus/prompts can be enabled via [1mmenu=on [22mas far as firmware/BIOS supports them. The default is non-interactive boot.

           A splash picture could be passed to bios, enabling user to show it as logo, when option splash=[4msp_name[24m is given and menu=on, If firmware/BIOS supports them. Currently Seabios for X86 system support it.  limitation: The
           splash file could be a jpeg file or a BMP file in 24 BPP format(true color). The resolution should be supported by the SVGA mode, so the recommended is 320x240, 640x480, 800x640.

           A timeout could be passed to bios, guest will pause for [4mrb_timeout[24m ms when boot failed, then reboot. If [4mrb_timeout[24m is '-1', guest will not reboot, qemu passes '-1' to bios by default. Currently Seabios for X86 system
           support it.

           Do strict boot via [1mstrict=on [22mas far as firmware/BIOS supports it. This only effects when boot priority is changed by bootindex options. The default is non-strict boot.

                   # try to boot from network first, then from hard disk
                   qemu-system-i386 -boot order=nc
                   # boot from CD-ROM first, switch back to default order after reboot
                   qemu-system-i386 -boot once=d
                   # boot with a splash picture for 5 seconds.
                   qemu-system-i386 -boot menu=on,splash=/root/boot.bmp,splash-time=5000

           Note: The legacy format '-boot [4mdrives[24m' is still supported but its use is discouraged as it may be removed from future versions.

       [1m-m [size=][4m[22mmegs[24m[1m[,slots=n,maxmem=size][0m
           Sets guest startup RAM size to [4mmegs[24m megabytes. Default is 128 MiB.  Optionally, a suffix of "M" or "G" can be used to signify a value in megabytes or gigabytes respectively. Optional pair [4mslots[24m, [4mmaxmem[24m could be used to
           set amount of hotpluggable memory slots and maximum amount of memory. Note that [4mmaxmem[24m must be aligned to the page size.

           For example, the following command-line sets the guest startup RAM size to 1GB, creates 3 slots to hotplug additional memory and sets the maximum memory the guest can reach to 4GB:

                   qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1G,slots=3,maxmem=4G

           If [4mslots[24m and [4mmaxmem[24m are not specified, memory hotplug won't be enabled and the guest startup RAM will never increase.

           need to use it on PC/Linux or PC/Windows hosts.

           The available layouts are:

           Add an IPMI BMC.  This is a simulation of a hardware management interface processor that normally sits on a system.  It provides a watchdog and the ability to reset and power control the system.  You need to connect this

           Add a connection to an external IPMI BMC simulator.  Instead of locally emulating the BMC like the above item, instead connect to an external entity that provides the IPMI services.

           A connection is made to an external BMC simulator.  If you do this, it is strongly recommended that you use the "reconnect=" chardev option to reconnect to the simulator if the connection is lost.  Note that if this is
           not used carefully, it can be a security issue, as the interface has the ability to send resets, NMIs, and power off the VM.  It's best if QEMU makes a connection to an external simulator running on a secure port on
           localhost, so neither the simulator nor QEMU is exposed to any outside network.

           See the "lanserv/README.vm" file in the OpenIPMI library for more details on the external interface.

           Define a new block driver node. Some of the options apply to all block drivers, other options are only accepted for a specific block driver. See below for a list of generic options and options for the most common block
           drivers.

           Options that expect a reference to another node (e.g. "file") can be given in two ways. Either you specify the node name of an already existing node (file=[4mnode-name[24m), or you define a new node inline, adding options for
           the referenced node after a dot (file.filename=[4mpath[24m,file.aio=native).

           A block driver node created with [1m-blockdev [22mcan be used for a guest device by specifying its node name for the "drive" property in a [1m-device [22margument that defines a block device.

           [1mValid options for any block driver node:[0m
               "driver"
                   Specifies the block driver to use for the given node.

               "node-name"
                   This defines the name of the block driver node by which it will be referenced later. The name must be unique, i.e. it must not match the name of a different block driver node, or (if you use [1m-drive [22mas well) the
                   ID of a drive.

                   If no node name is specified, it is automatically generated. The generated node name is not intended to be predictable and changes between QEMU invocations.  For the top level, an explicit node name must be
                   specified.

               "read-only"
                   Open the node read-only. Guest write attempts will fail.

               "cache.direct"
                   The host page cache can be avoided with [1mcache.direct=on[22m. This will attempt to do disk IO directly to the guest's memory. QEMU may still perform an internal copy of the data.

               "cache.no-flush"
                   In case you don't care about data integrity over host failures, you can use [1mcache.no-flush=on[22m. This option tells QEMU that it never needs to write any data to the disk but can instead keep things in cache. If
                   anything goes wrong, like your host losing power, the disk storage getting disconnected accidentally, etc. your image will most probably be rendered unusable.

               "discard=[4mdiscard[24m"
                   [4mdiscard[24m is one of "ignore" (or "off") or "unmap" (or "on") and controls whether "discard" (also known as "trim" or "unmap") requests are ignored or passed to the filesystem. Some machine types may not support
                   discard requests.

               "detect-zeroes=[4mdetect-zeroes[24m"
                   [4mdetect-zeroes[24m is "off", "on" or "unmap" and enables the automatic conversion of plain zero writes by the OS to driver specific optimized zero write commands. You may even choose "unmap" if [4mdiscard[24m is set to
                   "unmap" to allow a zero write to be converted to an "unmap" operation.

           [1mDriver-specific options for "file"[0m
               This is the protocol-level block driver for accessing regular files.

               "filename"
                   The path to the image file in the local filesystem

               "aio"
                   Specifies the AIO backend (threads/native, default: threads)

               "locking"
                   Specifies whether the image file is protected with Linux OFD / POSIX locks. The default is to use the Linux Open File Descriptor API if available, otherwise no lock is applied.  (auto/on/off, default: auto)

               Example:

                       -blockdev driver=file,node-name=disk,filename=disk.img

           [1mDriver-specific options for "raw"[0m
               This is the image format block driver for raw images. It is usually stacked on top of a protocol level block driver such as "file".

               "file"
                   Reference to or definition of the data source block driver node (e.g. a "file" driver node)

               Example 1:

                       -blockdev driver=file,node-name=disk_file,filename=disk.img

           [1mDriver-specific options for "qcow2"[0m
               This is the image format block driver for qcow2 images. It is usually stacked on top of a protocol level block driver such as "file".

               "file"
                   Reference to or definition of the data source block driver node (e.g. a "file" driver node)

               "backing"
                   Reference to or definition of the backing file block device (default is taken from the image file). It is allowed to pass "null" here in order to disable the default backing file.

               "lazy-refcounts"
                   Whether to enable the lazy refcounts feature (on/off; default is taken from the image file)

               "cache-size"
                   The maximum total size of the L2 table and refcount block caches in bytes (default: the sum of l2-cache-size and refcount-cache-size)

               "l2-cache-size"
                   The maximum size of the L2 table cache in bytes (default: if cache-size is not specified - 32M on Linux platforms, and 8M on non-Linux platforms; otherwise, as large as possible within the cache-size, while
                   permitting the requested or the minimal refcount cache size)

               "refcount-cache-size"
                   The maximum size of the refcount block cache in bytes (default: 4 times the cluster size; or if cache-size is specified, the part of it which is not used for the L2 cache)

               "cache-clean-interval"
                   Clean unused entries in the L2 and refcount caches. The interval is in seconds.  The default value is 600 on supporting platforms, and 0 on other platforms.  Setting it to 0 disables this feature.

               "pass-discard-request"
                   Whether discard requests to the qcow2 device should be forwarded to the data source (on/off; default: on if discard=unmap is specified, off otherwise)

               "pass-discard-snapshot"
                   Whether discard requests for the data source should be issued when a snapshot operation (e.g. deleting a snapshot) frees clusters in the qcow2 file (on/off; default: on)

               "pass-discard-other"
                   Whether discard requests for the data source should be issued on other occasions where a cluster gets freed (on/off; default: off)

               "overlap-check"
                   Which overlap checks to perform for writes to the image (none/constant/cached/all; default: cached). For details or finer granularity control refer to the QAPI documentation of "blockdev-add".

               Example 1:

                       -blockdev driver=file,node-name=my_file,filename=/tmp/disk.qcow2
                       -blockdev driver=qcow2,node-name=hda,file=my_file,overlap-check=none,cache-size=16777216

           [1mindex=[4m[22mindex[0m
               This option defines where is connected the drive by using an index in the list of available connectors of a given interface type.

           [1mmedia=[4m[22mmedia[0m
               This option defines the type of the media: disk or cdrom.

           [1msnapshot=[4m[22msnapshot[0m
               [4msnapshot[24m is "on" or "off" and controls snapshot mode for the given drive (see [1m-snapshot[22m).

           [1mcache=[4m[22mcache[0m
               [4mcache[24m is "none", "writeback", "unsafe", "directsync" or "writethrough" and controls how the host cache is used to access block data. This is a shortcut that sets the [1mcache.direct [22mand [1mcache.no-flush [22moptions (as in

               [4maio[24m is "threads", or "native" and selects between pthread based disk I/O and native Linux AIO.

           [1mformat=[4m[22mformat[0m
               Specify which disk [4mformat[24m will be used rather than detecting the format.  Can be used to specify format=raw to avoid interpreting an untrusted format header.

           [1mwerror=[4m[22maction[24m[1m,rerror=[4m[22maction[0m
               Specify which [4maction[24m to take on write and read errors. Valid actions are: "ignore" (ignore the error and try to continue), "stop" (pause QEMU), "report" (report the error to the guest), "enospc" (pause QEMU only if
               the host disk is full; report the error to the guest otherwise).  The default setting is [1mwerror=enospc [22mand [1mrerror=report[22m.

           [1mcopy-on-read=[4m[22mcopy-on-read[0m
               [4mcopy-on-read[24m is "on" or "off" and enables whether to copy read backing file sectors into the image file.

               Specify bursts in requests per second, either for all request types or for reads or writes only.  Bursts allow the guest I/O to spike above the limit temporarily.

           [1miops_size=[4m[22mis[0m
               Let every [4mis[24m bytes of a request count as a new request for iops throttling purposes.  Use this option to prevent guests from circumventing iops limits by sending fewer but larger requests.

           [1mgroup=[4m[22mg[0m
               Join a throttling quota group with given name [4mg[24m.  All drives that are members of the same group are accounted for together.  Use this option to prevent guests from circumventing throttling limits by using many small
               disks instead of a single larger disk.

           By default, the [1mcache.writeback=on [22mmode is used. It will report data writes as completed as soon as the data is present in the host page cache.  This is safe as long as your guest OS makes sure to correctly flush disk
           caches where needed. If your guest OS does not handle volatile disk write caches correctly and your host crashes or loses power, then the guest may experience data corruption.

           For such guests, you should consider using [1mcache.writeback=off[22m. This means that the host page cache will be used to read and write data, but write notification will be sent to the guest only after QEMU has made sure to
           flush each write to the disk. Be aware that this has a major impact on performance.

           When using the [1m-snapshot [22moption, unsafe caching is always used.

           Copy-on-read avoids accessing the same backing file sectors repeatedly and is useful when the backing file is over a slow network.  By default copy-on-read is off.

           Instead of [1m-cdrom [22myou can use:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=2,media=cdrom

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=3,media=disk

           You can open an image using pre-opened file descriptors from an fd set:

                   qemu-system-i386
                   -add-fd fd=3,set=2,opaque="rdwr:/path/to/file"
                   -add-fd fd=4,set=2,opaque="rdonly:/path/to/file"
                   -drive file=/dev/fdset/2,index=0,media=disk

           You can connect a CDROM to the slave of ide0:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,if=ide,index=1,media=cdrom

           If you don't specify the "file=" argument, you define an empty drive:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive if=ide,index=1,media=cdrom

           Instead of [1m-fda[22m, [1m-fdb[22m, you can use:

               If no TLS credentials are provided, the websocket connection runs in unencrypted mode. If TLS credentials are provided, the websocket connection requires encrypted client connections.

               The password must be set separately using the "set_password" command in the [1mpcsys_monitor[22m. The syntax to change your password is: "set_password <protocol> <password>" where <protocol> could be either "vnc" or

               If you would like to change <protocol> password expiration, you should use "expire_password <protocol> <expiration-time>" where expiration time could be one of the following options: now, never, +seconds or UNIX time
               of expiration, e.g. +60 to make password expire in 60 seconds, or 1335196800 to make password expire on "Mon Apr 23 12:00:00 EDT 2012" (UNIX time for this date and time).

               You can also use keywords "now" or "never" for the expiration time to allow <protocol> password to expire immediately or never expire.

               Require that the client use SASL to authenticate with the VNC server.  The exact choice of authentication method used is controlled from the system / user's SASL configuration file for the 'qemu' service. This is
               typically found in /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf. If running QEMU as an unprivileged user, an environment variable SASL_CONF_PATH can be used to make it search alternate locations for the service config.  While some SASL auth
               methods can also provide data encryption (eg GSSAPI), it is recommended that SASL always be combined with the 'tls' and 'x509' settings to enable use of SSL and server certificates. This ensures a data encryption
               preventing compromise of authentication credentials. See the [1mvnc_security [22msection for details on using SASL authentication.

           [1macl [22mTurn on access control lists for checking of the x509 client certificate and SASL party. For x509 certs, the ACL check is made against the certificate's distinguished name. This is something that looks like
               "C=GB,O=ACME,L=Boston,CN=bob". For SASL party, the ACL check is made against the username, which depending on the SASL plugin, may include a realm component, eg "bob" or "bob@EXAMPLE.COM".  When the [1macl [22mflag is set,
               the initial access list will be empty, with a "deny" policy. Thus no one will be allowed to use the VNC server until the ACLs have been loaded. This can be achieved using the "acl" monitor command.

           [1mlossy[0m
               Enable lossy compression methods (gradient, JPEG, ...). If this option is set, VNC client may receive lossy framebuffer updates depending on its encoding settings. Enabling this option can save a lot of bandwidth at
               the expense of quality.

           [1mnon-adaptive[0m
               Disable adaptive encodings. Adaptive encodings are enabled by default.  An adaptive encoding will try to detect frequently updated screen regions, and send updates in these regions using a lossy encoding (like JPEG).
               This can be really helpful to save bandwidth when playing videos. Disabling adaptive encodings restores the original static behavior of encodings like Tight.

           [1mshare=[allow-exclusive|force-shared|ignore][0m
               Set display sharing policy.  'allow-exclusive' allows clients to ask for exclusive access.  As suggested by the rfb spec this is implemented by dropping other connections.  Connecting multiple clients in parallel
               requires all clients asking for a shared session (vncviewer: -shared switch).  This is the default.  'force-shared' disables exclusive client access.  Useful for shared desktop sessions, where you don't want someone
               forgetting specify -shared disconnect everybody else.  'ignore' completely ignores the shared flag and allows everybody connect unconditionally.  Doesn't conform to the rfb spec but is traditional QEMU behavior.

               are arriving in bulk.  Possible causes for the latter are flaky network connections, or scripts for automated testing.

               built-in DHCP server). By specifying [4mhostaddr[24m, the rule can be bound to a specific host interface. If no connection type is set, TCP is used. This option can be given multiple times.

               For example, to redirect host X11 connection from screen 1 to guest screen 0, use the following:

                       # on the host
                       qemu-system-i386 -nic user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:6001-:6000
                       # this host xterm should open in the guest X11 server
                       xterm -display :1

               To redirect telnet connections from host port 5555 to telnet port on the guest, use the following:

                       # on the host
                       qemu-system-i386 -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:23
                       telnet localhost 5555

               Then when you use on the host "telnet localhost 5555", you connect to the guest telnet server.

               You can either use a chardev directly and have that one used throughout QEMU's lifetime, like in the following example:

                       # open 10.10.1.1:4321 on bootup, connect 10.0.2.100:1234 to it whenever
                       # the guest accesses it
                       qemu-system-i386 -nic user,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:1234-tcp:10.10.1.1:4321

               Or you can execute a command on every TCP connection established by the guest, so that QEMU behaves similar to an inetd process for that virtual server:

                       # call "netcat 10.10.1.1 4321" on every TCP connection to 10.0.2.100:1234
                       # and connect the TCP stream to its stdin/stdout

           Backend is one of: [1mnull[22m, [1msocket[22m, [1mudp[22m, [1mmsmouse[22m, [1mvc[22m, [1mringbuf[22m, [1mfile[22m, [1mpipe[22m, [1mconsole[22m, [1mserial[22m, [1mpty[22m, [1mstdio[22m, [1mbraille[22m, [1mtty[22m, [1mparallel[22m, [1mparport[22m, [1mspicevmc[22m, [1mspiceport[22m.  The specific backend will determine the applicable options.

           Use "-chardev help" to print all available chardev backend types.

           All devices must have an id, which can be any string up to 127 characters long.  It is used to uniquely identify this device in other command line directives.

           A character device may be used in multiplexing mode by multiple front-ends.  Specify [1mmux=on [22mto enable this mode.  A multiplexer is a "1:N" device, and here the "1" end is your specified chardev backend, and the "N" end
           is the various parts of QEMU that can talk to a chardev.  If you create a chardev with [1mid=myid [22mand [1mmux=on[22m, QEMU will create a multiplexer with your specified ID, and you can then configure multiple front ends to use that
           chardev ID for their input/output. Up to four different front ends can be connected to a single multiplexed chardev. (Without multiplexing enabled, a chardev can only be used by a single front end.)  For instance you
           could use this to allow a single stdio chardev to be used by two serial ports and the QEMU monitor:

                   -chardev stdio,mux=on,id=char0 \
                   -mon chardev=char0,mode=readline \
                   -serial chardev:char0 \
                   -serial chardev:char0

           You can have more than one multiplexer in a system configuration; for instance you could have a TCP port multiplexed between UART 0 and UART 1, and stdio multiplexed between the QEMU monitor and a parallel port:

                   -chardev stdio,mux=on,id=char0 \
                   -mon chardev=char0,mode=readline \
                   -parallel chardev:char0 \
                   -chardev tcp,...,mux=on,id=char1 \
                   -serial chardev:char1 \
                   -serial chardev:char1

           When you're using a multiplexed character device, some escape sequences are interpreted in the input.

           Note that some other command line options may implicitly create multiplexed character backends; for instance [1m-serial mon:stdio [22mcreates a multiplexed stdio backend connected to the serial port and the QEMU monitor, and
           [1m-nographic [22malso multiplexes the console and the monitor to stdio.

           There is currently no support for multiplexing in the other direction (where a single QEMU front end takes input and output from multiple chardevs).

           Every backend supports the [1mlogfile [22moption, which supplies the path to a file to record all data transmitted via the backend. The [1mlogappend [22moption controls whether the log file will be truncated or appended to when
           opened.

       The available backends are:

       [1m-chardev null,id=[4m[22mid[0m
           A void device. This device will not emit any data, and will drop any data it receives. The null backend does not take any options.

           The specific backend type will determine the applicable options.  The "-tpmdev" option creates the TPM backend and requires a "-device" option that specifies the TPM frontend interface model.

           Use "-tpmdev help" to print all available TPM backend types.

       The available backends are:

       [1m-tpmdev passthrough,id=[4m[22mid[24m[1m,path=[4m[22mpath[24m[1m,cancel-path=[4m[22mcancel-path[0m
           (Linux-host only) Enable access to the host's TPM using the passthrough driver.

           [1mpath [22mspecifies the path to the host's TPM device, i.e., on a Linux host this would be "/dev/tpm0".  [1mpath [22mis optional and by default "/dev/tpm0" is used.

           [1mcancel-path [22mspecifies the path to the host TPM device's sysfs entry allowing for cancellation of an ongoing TPM command.  [1mcancel-path [22mis optional and by default QEMU will search for the sysfs entry to use.

           Some notes about using the host's TPM with the passthrough driver:

           The TPM device accessed by the passthrough driver must not be used by any other application on the host.

           Since the host's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) has already initialized the TPM, the VM's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) will not be able to initialize the TPM again and may therefore not show a TPM-specific menu that would otherwise allow
           the user to configure the TPM, e.g., allow the user to enable/disable or activate/deactivate the TPM.  Further, if TPM ownership is released from within a VM then the host's TPM will get disabled and deactivated. To
           enable and activate the TPM again afterwards, the host has to be rebooted and the user is required to enter the firmware's menu to enable and activate the TPM.  If the TPM is left disabled and/or deactivated most TPM
           commands will fail.

           To create a passthrough TPM use the following two options:

                   -tpmdev passthrough,id=tpm0 -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=tpm0

           Note that the "-tpmdev" id is "tpm0" and is referenced by "tpmdev=tpm0" in the device option.

           The terminating NUL character of the contents of [4mstr[24m will not be included as part of the fw_cfg item data. To insert contents with embedded NUL characters, you have to use the [4mfile[24m parameter.

           The fw_cfg entries are passed by QEMU through to the guest.

           Example:

                   -fw_cfg name=opt/com.mycompany/blob,file=./my_blob.bin

           creates an fw_cfg entry named opt/com.mycompany/blob with contents from ./my_blob.bin.

               If you just want a simple readonly console you can use "netcat" or "nc", by starting QEMU with: "-serial udp::4555" and nc as: "nc -u -l -p 4555". Any time QEMU writes something to that port it will appear in the
               netconsole session.

               If you plan to send characters back via netconsole or you want to stop and start QEMU a lot of times, you should have QEMU use the same source port each time by using something like "-serial udp::4555@4556" to QEMU.
               Another approach is to use a patched version of netcat which can listen to a TCP port and send and receive characters via udp.  If you have a patched version of netcat which activates telnet remote echo and single
               char transfer, then you can use the following options to set up a netcat redirector to allow telnet on port 5555 to access the QEMU port.

           By default the RTC is driven by the host system time. This allows using of the RTC as accurate reference clock inside the guest, specifically if the host time is smoothly following an accurate external reference clock,
           e.g. via NTP.  If you want to isolate the guest time from the host, you can set [1mclock [22mto "rt" instead, which provides a host monotonic clock if host support it.  To even prevent the RTC from progressing during
           suspension, you can set [1mclock [22mto "vm" (virtual clock). [1mclock=vm [22mis recommended especially in icount mode in order to preserve determinism; however, note that in icount mode the speed of the virtual clock is variable and
           can in general differ from the host clock.

           Enable [1mdriftfix [22m(i386 targets only) if you experience time drift problems, specifically with Windows' ACPI HAL. This option will try to figure out how many timer interrupts were not processed by the Windows guest and

           Enable virtual instruction counter.  The virtual cpu will execute one instruction every 2^[4mN[24m ns of virtual time.  If "auto" is specified then the virtual cpu speed will be automatically adjusted to keep virtual time
           within a few seconds of real time.

           When the virtual cpu is sleeping, the virtual time will advance at default speed unless [1msleep=on|off [22mis specified.  With [1msleep=on|off[22m, the virtual time will jump to the next timer deadline instantly whenever the virtual
           cpu goes to sleep mode and will not advance if no timer is enabled. This behavior give deterministic execution times from the guest point of view.

           Note that while this option can give deterministic behavior, it does not provide cycle accurate emulation.  Modern CPUs contain superscalar out of order cores with complex cache hierarchies.  The number of instructions
           executed often has little or no correlation with actual performance.

           [1malign=on [22mwill activate the delay algorithm which will try to synchronise the host clock and the virtual clock. The goal is to have a guest running at the real frequency imposed by the shift option.  Whenever the guest
           clock is behind the host clock and if [1malign=on [22mis specified then we print a message to the user to inform about the delay.  Currently this option does not work when [1mshift [22mis "auto".  Note: The sync algorithm will work
           for those shift values for which the guest clock runs ahead of the host clock. Typically this happens when the shift value is high (how high depends on the host machine).

           When [1mrr [22moption is specified deterministic record/replay is enabled.  Replay log is written into [4mfilename[24m file in record mode and read from this file in replay mode.

           Option rrsnapshot is used to create new vm snapshot named [4msnapshot[24m at the start of execution recording. In replay mode this option is used to load the initial VM state.

       [1m-watchdog [4m[22mmodel[0m
           Create a virtual hardware watchdog device.  Once enabled (by a guest action), the watchdog must be periodically polled by an agent inside the guest or else the guest will be restarted. Choose a model for which your guest
           has drivers.

           The [4mmodel[24m is the model of hardware watchdog to emulate. Use "-watchdog help" to list available hardware models. Only one watchdog can be enabled for a guest.

           The following models may be available:

           [1mib700[0m
               iBASE 700 is a very simple ISA watchdog with a single timer.

       [1m-watchdog-action [4m[22maction[0m
           The [4maction[24m controls what QEMU will do when the watchdog timer expires.  The default is "reset" (forcefully reset the guest).  Other possible actions are: "shutdown" (attempt to gracefully shutdown the guest), "poweroff"
           (forcefully poweroff the guest), "inject-nmi" (inject a NMI into the guest), "pause" (pause the guest), "debug" (print a debug message and continue), or "none" (do nothing).

           Note that the "shutdown" action requires that the guest responds to ACPI signals, which it may not be able to do in the sort of situations where the watchdog would have expired, and thus "-watchdog-action shutdown" is
           not recommended for production use.

           Examples:

           different character from the ascii control keys where 1 through 26 map to Control-a through Control-z.  For instance you could use the either of the following to change the escape character to Control-t.

               Creates a memory file backend object, which can be used to back the guest RAM with huge pages.

               The [1mid [22mparameter is a unique ID that will be used to reference this memory region when configuring the [1m-numa [22margument.

               The [1msize [22moption provides the size of the memory region, and accepts common suffixes, eg [1m500M[22m.

               The [1mmem-path [22mprovides the path to either a shared memory or huge page filesystem mount.

               The [1mshare [22mboolean option determines whether the memory region is marked as private to QEMU, or shared. The latter allows a co-operating external process to access the QEMU memory region.

               The [1mshare [22mis also required for pvrdma devices due to limitations in the RDMA API provided by Linux.

               Setting share=on might affect the ability to configure NUMA bindings for the memory backend under some circumstances, see Documentation/vm/numa_memory_policy.txt on the Linux kernel source tree for additional
               details.

               Setting the [1mdiscard-data [22mboolean option to [4mon[24m indicates that file contents can be destroyed when QEMU exits, to avoid unnecessarily flushing data to the backing file.  Note that [1mdiscard-data [22mis only an optimization,
               and QEMU might not discard file contents if it aborts unexpectedly or is terminated using SIGKILL.

               The [1mmerge [22mboolean option enables memory merge, also known as MADV_MERGEABLE, so that Kernel Samepage Merging will consider the pages for memory deduplication.

               Setting the [1mdump [22mboolean option to [4moff[24m excludes the memory from core dumps. This feature is also known as MADV_DONTDUMP.

               The [1mprealloc [22mboolean option enables memory preallocation.

               The [1mhost-nodes [22moption binds the memory range to a list of NUMA host nodes.

               The [1mpolicy [22moption sets the NUMA policy to one of the following values:

               [4mdefault[0m
                   default host policy

               [4mpreferred[0m

               [4minterleave[0m
                   interleave memory allocations across the given host node list

               The [1malign [22moption specifies the base address alignment when QEMU [1mmmap[22m(2) [1mmem-path[22m, and accepts common suffixes, eg [1m2M[22m. Some backend store specified by [1mmem-path [22mrequires an alignment different than the default one used
               by QEMU, eg the device DAX /dev/dax0.0 requires 2M alignment rather than 4K. In such cases, users can specify the required alignment via this option.

               The [1mpmem [22moption specifies whether the backing file specified by [1mmem-path [22mis in host persistent memory that can be accessed using the SNIA NVM programming model (e.g. Intel NVDIMM).  If [1mpmem [22mis set to 'on', QEMU will
               take necessary operations to guarantee the persistence of its own writes to [1mmem-path [22m(e.g. in vNVDIMM label emulation and live migration).

               Creates an anonymous memory file backend object, which allows QEMU to share the memory with an external process (e.g. when using vhost-user). The memory is allocated with memfd and optional sealing. (Linux only)

               The [1mseal [22moption creates a sealed-file, that will block further resizing the memory ('on' by default).

               The [1mhugetlb [22moption specify the file to be created resides in the hugetlbfs filesystem (since Linux 4.14).  Used in conjunction with the [1mhugetlb [22moption, the [1mhugetlbsize [22moption specify the hugetlb page size on systems
               that support multiple hugetlb page sizes (it must be a power of 2 value supported by the system).

               In some versions of Linux, the [1mhugetlb [22moption is incompatible with the [1mseal [22moption (requires at least Linux 4.16).

               Please refer to [1mmemory-backend-file [22mfor a description of the other options.

               the peer credentials will be verified. With x509 certificates, this implies that the clients must be provided with valid client certificates too.

               The [4mdir[24m parameter tells QEMU where to find the credential files. For server endpoints, this directory may contain a file [4mdh-params.pem[24m providing diffie-hellman parameters to use for the TLS server. If the file is

               upfront and saved.

               For x509 certificate credentials the directory will contain further files providing the x509 certificates. The certificates must be stored in PEM format, in filenames [4mca-cert.pem[24m, [4mca-crl.pem[24m (optional),
               [4mserver-cert.pem[24m (only servers), [4mserver-key.pem[24m (only servers), [4mclient-cert.pem[24m (only clients), and [4mclient-key.pem[24m (only clients).

               For the [4mserver-key.pem[24m and [4mclient-key.pem[24m files which contain sensitive private keys, it is possible to use an encrypted version by providing the [4mpasswordid[24m parameter. This provides the ID of a previously created
               "secret" object containing the password for decryption.

               The [4mpriority[24m parameter allows to override the global default priority used by gnutls. This can be useful if the system administrator needs to use a weaker set of crypto priorities for QEMU without potentially forcing

               Defines a secret to store a password, encryption key, or some other sensitive data. The sensitive data can either be passed directly via the [4mdata[24m parameter, or indirectly via the [4mfile[24m parameter. Using the [4mdata[0m
               parameter is insecure unless the sensitive data is encrypted.

               The sensitive data can be provided in raw format (the default), or base64.  When encoded as JSON, the raw format only supports valid UTF-8 characters, so base64 is recommended for sending binary data. QEMU will
               convert from which ever format is provided to the format it needs internally. eg, an RBD password can be provided in raw format, even though it will be base64 encoded when passed onto the RBD sever.

               For added protection, it is possible to encrypt the data associated with a secret using the AES-256-CBC cipher. Use of encryption is indicated by providing the [4mkeyid[24m and [4miv[24m parameters. The [4mkeyid[24m parameter provides
               the ID of a previously defined secret that contains the AES-256 decryption key. This key should be 32-bytes long and be base64 encoded. The [4miv[24m parameter provides the random initialization vector used for encryption
               of this particular secret and should be a base64 encrypted string of the 16-byte IV.

               The simplest (insecure) usage is to provide the secret inline

                       # $QEMU -object secret,id=sec0,data=letmein,format=raw

               The simplest secure usage is to provide the secret via a file

               # printf "letmein" > mypasswd.txt # $QEMU -object secret,id=sec0,file=mypasswd.txt,format=raw

               For greater security, AES-256-CBC should be used. To illustrate usage, consider the openssl command line tool which can encrypt the data. Note that when encrypting, the plaintext must be padded to the cipher block
               size (32 bytes) using the standard PKCS#5/6 compatible padding algorithm.

               First a master key needs to be created in base64 encoding:

                       # openssl rand -base64 32 > key.b64
                       # KEY=$(base64 -d key.b64 | hexdump  -v -e '/1 "%02X"')

               Each secret to be encrypted needs to have a random initialization vector generated. These do not need to be kept secret

                       # openssl rand -base64 16 > iv.b64
                       # IV=$(base64 -d iv.b64 | hexdump  -v -e '/1 "%02X"')

               The secret to be defined can now be encrypted, in this case we're telling openssl to base64 encode the result, but it could be left as raw bytes if desired.

                       # SECRET=$(printf "letmein" |
                       openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -K $KEY -iv $IV)

               When launching QEMU, create a master secret pointing to "key.b64" and specify that to be used to decrypt the user password. Pass the contents of "iv.b64" to the second secret

                       # $QEMU \
                       -object secret,id=secmaster0,format=base64,file=key.b64 \
                       -object secret,id=sec0,keyid=secmaster0,format=base64,\
                       data=$SECRET,iv=$(<iv.b64)

               Create a Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) guest object, which can be used to provide the guest memory encryption support on AMD processors.

               When memory encryption is enabled, one of the physical address bit (aka the C-bit) is utilized to mark if a memory page is protected. The [1mcbitpos [22mis used to provide the C-bit position. The C-bit position is Host
               family dependent hence user must provide this value. On EPYC, the value should be 47.

               When memory encryption is enabled, we loose certain bits in physical address space.  The [1mreduced-phys-bits [22mis used to provide the number of bits we loose in physical address space. Similar to C-bit, the value is Host
               family dependent.  On EPYC, the value should be 5.

               The [1msev-device [22mprovides the device file to use for communicating with the SEV firmware running inside AMD Secure Processor. The default device is '/dev/sev'. If hardware supports memory encryption then /dev/sev
               devices are created by CCP driver.

               The [1mpolicy [22mprovides the guest policy to be enforced by the SEV firmware and restrict what configuration and operational commands can be performed on this guest by the hypervisor. The policy should be provided by the
               guest owner and is bound to the guest and cannot be changed throughout the lifetime of the guest.  The default is 0.

               If guest [1mpolicy [22mallows sharing the key with another SEV guest then [1mhandle [22mcan be use to provide handle of the guest from which to share the key.

               The [1mdh-cert-file [22mand [1msession-file [22mprovides the guest owner's Public Diffie-Hillman key defined in SEV spec. The PDH and session parameters are used for establishing a cryptographic session with the guest owner to
               negotiate keys used for attestation. The file must be encoded in base64.

               e.g to launch a SEV guest

                       # $QEMU \
                       ......
                       -object sev-guest,id=sev0,cbitpos=47,reduced-phys-bits=5 \
                       -machine ...,memory-encryption=sev0

[1mNOTES[0m
       In addition to using normal file images for the emulated storage devices, QEMU can also use networked resources such as iSCSI devices. These are specified using a special URL syntax.

       [1miSCSI[0m
           iSCSI support allows QEMU to access iSCSI resources directly and use as images for the guest storage. Both disk and cdrom images are supported.

           Syntax for specifying iSCSI LUNs is "iscsi://<target-ip>[:<port>]/<target-iqn>/<lun>"

           By default qemu will use the iSCSI initiator-name 'iqn.2008-11.org.linux-kvm[:<name>]' but this can also be set from the command line or a configuration file.

           Since version Qemu 2.4 it is possible to specify a iSCSI request timeout to detect stalled requests and force a reestablishment of the session. The timeout is specified in seconds. The default is 0 which means no
           timeout. Libiscsi 1.15.0 or greater is required for this feature.

           Example (without authentication):

                   qemu-system-i386 -iscsi initiator-name=iqn.2001-04.com.example:my-initiator \
                                    -cdrom iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/2 \
                                    -drive file=iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1

           Example (CHAP username/password via URL):

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=iscsi://user%password@192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1

           Example (CHAP username/password via environment variables):

                   LIBISCSI_CHAP_USERNAME="user" \
                   LIBISCSI_CHAP_PASSWORD="password" \
                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1
